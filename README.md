# cBridges.github.io
My text-based game-style personal website! This will be built using Blazor WebAssembly as an opportunity explore it, and showcase:
- What I'm about
- Projects
- Blogs
with some extra fun and adventure beyond those key things 😄

The site is currently under construction in public 🏗️ I'm currently "researching" (by which I mean "playing loads of text-based games"), and figuring out how to I wish this to look and flow.
